# mint-amd-gaming
Small shell script to prepare stock Linux Mint for gaming (AMD GPU's only!)

Please inspect the script before you execute it, it might do things you don't want it to do!

## Usage:

Make it executable with `chmod +x ./mint-gaming-setup.sh`, then:

`sudo ./mint-gaming-setup.sh` [--mesa oibaf|kisak]

(Yes, you can choose between different Mesa sources. Kisak is used by default,
so if you want to use oibaf, you must add `--mesa oibaf` after the command.)
